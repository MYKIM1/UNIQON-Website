        <img src="index image.001.png" width="100%">
        <p>UNIQON provide <strong>the <u>wireless lighting control</u> technology</strong> for fixtures gives you more control over your light.</p>
        <p>And BLE mesh is the best choice for smart lightings.</p>
        <p>Lightings are everywhere in a building, and when equipped with sensors can monitor building conditions as well as luminaire performance. Sensors can be configured to detect fire, temperature, brightness, motion, and other hazards, including a programmed response to trigger a fire alarm or alert security services. However, to be effective,luminaires have to be expandable, seamlessly interconnected. This is where BLE mesh plays a role.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:60px;">Many vendors are beginning to standardize on Bluetooth mesh as an open and robust wireless approach that can scale to handle control, monitoring, and management in any building.</p>
        <p>Through our solution, smart LED drivers will have microcontrollers, BLE mesh modules so they can be programmed to control lights remotely by changing light intensity and hue or can be programmed for specialty applications lights.</p>
        <p>Now our partner LED lighting manufacturers have started to successfully implement BLE mesh to create an interconnected lighting system.</p>
        <p>We will  build smart lighting control solution for lighting fixtures with hardware, cloud, and web-App based on the BLE mesh. With this IoT lighting platform that can be customized to your specification, we will develop the exact lighting control solution you want. <u>Contact UNIQON</u>(<a href="">uniqon@uniqon.com</a>) to discuss how our wireless lighting control gives your fixtures more control over light.</p>
